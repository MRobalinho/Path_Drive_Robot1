### Define Waypoints for a Robot drive, for the desired path for the robot

This example demonstrates how to control a robot to follow a desired path using a Robot Simulator. The example uses the Pure Pursuit path following controller to drive a simulated robot along a predetermined path. A desired path is a set of waypoints defined explicitly or computed using a path planner (refer to Path Planning in Environments of Different Complexity). The Pure Pursuit path following controller for a simulated differential drive robot is created and computes the control commands to follow a given path. The computed control commands are used to drive the simulated robot along the desired trajectory to follow the desired path based on the Pure Pursuit controller.
